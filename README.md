Dear GitHub,

You have done so much to grow the open source community and make it really
accessible to users. Somehow you have us chasing stars and filling up squares,
improving the worldâ€™s software in the process.

However, git is and should remain a distributed version control system and 
github should remain a hub in many. It should not be and should not aim to 
be irreplaceable. 

Dear project maintainers, 

Please try to avoid locking yourself with a particular vendor. Nothing good 
comes out of it. 

Sincerely, 
@9034725985 
(yes, I see how hypocritical I look when I use a markdown decoration here)
